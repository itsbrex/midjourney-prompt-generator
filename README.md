# Midjourney Prompt Generator

This project is a prompt generator that generates random prompts for [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com). The prompts are generated based on a YAML file containing options for different design elements.

## Usage
```
python3 midijourney_prompt_generator.py
```
Modify input.yaml to suit your needs, then 20 random prompts will be printed to the console and saved in `output.txt` with a timestamp.

## Customization

To customize the design options, modify the `input.yaml` file. The YAML file has the following structure:

- `command`: The blueprint for the prompt command. Modify this to suit your specific requirements.
- `style`: A list of different styles.
- `symbol`: A list of different symbols.
- `color`: A list of common design colors.
- `background`: A list of common background colors or gradients.
- `additional_element`: A list of additional design elements.

Modify the options under each category to match your desired choices.

## Example

Here is an example of a generated prompt:

```
Design of futuristic logo featuring a piano keyboard in red on a blackish gradient background. Include pattern as an additional design element. --v 5 --ar 16:9 --c 20 --q 1
```
[![Example Prompt](./example.png)](./example.png)

In this example, the script randomly selected the "futuristic" style, "piano keyboard" symbol, "red" color, "blackish gradient" background, and "pattern" as the additional design element.

The additional options `--v 5 --ar 16:9 --c 100 --q 1` are added to the end of the command for additional configuration. These options are not generated randomly and are the same for all prompts. 
- The `--ar` option is to set the desired [aspect ratio](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/aspect-ratios).
- The `--c` option is for [chaos](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/chaos) and is used to set how much variation there is. 
- The `--q` option is to set the [quality](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality) of the generated images (`0.25`, `0.5`, or `1`). Higher values use more of your subscription's GPU minutes and take longer to render.

## Output

The generated prompts will be saved in the `output.txt` file with an appended timestamp so you can save all your previous prompts. Each prompt will be listed on a separate line in the file.
